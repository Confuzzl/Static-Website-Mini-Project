        <p>
            &emsp;I don't actually go out all that much.
            I haven't even been around the downtown area around Tech as much as I should.
            One place that I can say that I used to enjoy was my elementary school's court.
            The court was absolutely massive and when I was younger I would play soccer there all the time but the school underwent construction of an entire new building which completely halved the court.

            &emsp;Not very much of a controversial statement, but I absolutely despise the metro system.
            Obviously delays and halts are rarely the fault of the MTA, but there's still so much more to desired.
            I've been to a lot of other countries, and as many people may guess, foreigh subway systems completely sweep the NYC MTA.

            &emsp;I can't exactly say where this happens, but sometimes walking outside is an assault on my senses.
            Sometimes the streets will stench of urine and smoke and who knows what else is in the air that makes me think about wearing a mask again.
